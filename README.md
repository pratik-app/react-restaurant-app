# The Gericht - Restaurant-React

Welcome to the repository of "The Gericht," a modern, static website built to showcase a beautiful restaurant's presence online. This project demonstrates the ability to translate a Figma design into a fully functional static website using ReactJS, emphasizing front-end development skills and design implementation.

## Description

"The Gericht" is not just a static website; it is a demonstration of modern web development capabilities. Originally crafted in Figma, the design was brought to life using the robust and flexible ReactJS framework, providing an engaging user experience and a glimpse into the meticulous attention to detail involved in developing websites from design mockups.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Ensure you have the following installed before you proceed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installing and Running

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/the-gericht-restaurant-react.git
npm install

Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

    npm start
        Runs the app in the development mode.
        Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.
    npm test
        Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
    npm run build
        Builds the app for production to the build folder.
        It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
    npm run eject
        Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can’t go back!
        If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single-build dependency from your project.
